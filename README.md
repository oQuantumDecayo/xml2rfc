# xml2rfc
A formatter for the "xml2rfc" vocabulary, implemented in XSLT.

Note that this repository just mirrors a subset of a different (private) repository.

It's here to make it easier to submit bugs and change requests, and to follow the development in general.

If you need the full distribution, please get it from

(with full documentation both contained in the archive, and online at https://www.greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html)

Note that the full distribution contains derived/generated files that are needed for Epub and PDF generation.
